[Sparkbox](http://www.seesparkbox.com) shares it's Style Prototype to help designers create deliverable designs that behave in the browser just as the final website would. I agree that this is a common problem for designers working solely in Photoshop, it really changes the client's perspective if they know how it will work.

With web design changing as fast as ever, the Sparkbox team can't stop looking for new ways to refine our process to meet the growing challenges. One of the greatest challenges we all face in this era of responsive web design is achieving a balance between efficient workflow and effective client deliverables. It was with this in mind that the Style Prototype was born.

Real web designers write code. Always have, always will.
