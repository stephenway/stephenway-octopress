I really need to get off GoDaddy.

This hacker news thread is also a good resource for some free alternative DNS services if you don't want to pay transfer fees.

Update: Moved DNS over to Zerigo, just in time for the third timeout on GoDaddy. Cheers!

Update 2: [More details](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/09/godaddy-moves-to-verisign/) on the outage as GoDaddy itself moves it's own DNS to Verisign.
