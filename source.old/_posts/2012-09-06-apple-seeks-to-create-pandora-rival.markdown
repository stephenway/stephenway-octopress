Apple Inc. is in talks to license music for a custom-radio service similar to the popular one operated by Pandora Media Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be a bid by the hardware maker to expand its dominance in online music.

I see Apple working on 3 potential apps to be included in or alongside iTunes:

* Video sharing service (YouTube)
* Music recognition (Shazam)
* Radio (Pandora)

I think the latter would be the easiest for them to release this year. Also, wouldn't be hard for them to raise the bar over Pandora and Spotify with the iTunes Store catalog.
