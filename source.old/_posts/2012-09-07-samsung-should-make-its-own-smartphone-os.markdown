If you don't remember Samsung created Bada OS which ended in a slow death.

On the other hand, while once-mighty mobile giants like RIM and Microsoft are already fighting for third place, both companies have struggled with delays â€” so third place could be a low-hanging fruit for a competent contender.

Samsung would have a chance at starting over for a chance at third place if it were not so late to the after party.
