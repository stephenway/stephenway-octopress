I've been so busy lately I forgot to report on my latest release, it's not groundbreaking but definitely useful!

BrowserStack is a service that provides cross-browser, cross-mobile testing to developers who need to test javascript and/or css. I thought it was so handy that I wanted to cut out some of the time I was spending with URLs and just get a set of bookmarks that let me call up a browser from the current site I was on. This is a complete set of browsers offered on this service.
