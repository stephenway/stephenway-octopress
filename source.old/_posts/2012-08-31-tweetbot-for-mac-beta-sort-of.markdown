After Tapbots pulling Tweetbot alpha, an early beta upgrade is now available.

{% blockquote %}
It’s important to realize that with this build you can’t add or reauthorize any accounts. If you delete an account or de-authorize an existing account you will not be able to add it again until the final version comes out.

I wasn't aware that a Mac app needs to go further than Mountain Lion's [Twitter integration](http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#twitter). If your planning on using Tweetbot beta, don't change your username or password until the final release comes out.
