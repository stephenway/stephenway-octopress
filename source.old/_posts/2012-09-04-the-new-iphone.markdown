Today journalists were delighted with an invitation to an Apple Media Event on September 12th. The image simply has a big number 12 on it with the shadow of the 12 extended to look like a 5. It's impossible not to make the assumption that based on the presence of the number 5 that Apple must be naming the next device iPhone 5.

After looking at this leaked photo of a printer holding up a printed sheet for the iPhone 5, it is clear that the only number they are promoting is iOS6 because it also shows Apple using the term "The New iPhone".

I think Apple is just preping the media with a simple number they can understand. Making the shadow say anything else like "New" would communicate even less than 5. So it seems that Apple is sticking with the "New" term and removing device versioning entirely.
