Speaking of Yeoman, there is also a new package manager called Bower. It lets you install assets into your app like jQuery or backbone.

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
$ bower install jquery
$ bower install git://github.com/maccman/package-jquery.git
$ bower install http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js
$ bower install ./repos/jquery
{% endcodeblock %}

For those of you familiar with Sublime Text's [3rd party package manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), this is a breath of fresh air for managing projects in a shell.

I didn't link to it's homepage because it's just an [image and a button](http://twitter.github.com/bower/).
