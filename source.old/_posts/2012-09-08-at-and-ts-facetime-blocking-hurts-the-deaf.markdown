Brendan Grammer writing for Wired:

It’s disappointing that AT&T is standing in the way of innovation that addresses the needs of its deaf and hard-of-hearing customers. Sometimes it takes a while (and some prodding) for technology and technology companies to catch up to and embrace accessibility. In this case the technology is there, but it’s AT&T that’s throwing up the barrier.

There are no technical limitations based on what plan you purchase to use FaceTime over cellular. AT&T doesn't want to see their revenue from voice plans go away. That moment I recieved my first FaceTime call from my Dad not being on a Wi-Fi network was definitely magical. I hope the deaf community will get that experience soon.
