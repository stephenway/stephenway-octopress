Drew Barontini talks about learning to stay modular in his stylesheets for application development, for instance simplifying a collection of content like a comment or review or user block and making reusable styles that are general to all of them.

I found myself repeating this pattern multiple times throughout the application that I am currently working on.
{% endblockquote %}

This seems like it could have been a lesson in CSS pre-processor mixins or @extend.
