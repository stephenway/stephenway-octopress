A new front-end toolset, available today.
{% blockquote %}
Yeoman is a robust and opinionated set of tools, libraries, and a workflow that can help developers quickly build beautiful, compelling web apps.
{% endblockquote %}

Simply open your shell and run:
{% codeblock lang:sh %}
$ curl -L get.yeoman.io | bash
{% endcodeblock %}

Then to start a project, make a new directory and run:
{% codeblock lang:sh %}
$ yeoman init
{% endcodeblock %}

Note: If you already have node.js and NPM, upgrade them before installing Yeoman.
