When I look at how big this thing is, I just think about how nice my 4S feels in my hand just using one hand. However I do have some big hands, I can easily touch any part of the screen with one hand. It's important, using one hand when I'm holding my son, or holding a drink while I skim over the morning Twitter feed. The true test is always going to the Apple Store and holding one in your hand to see if it could be a match.

## Ultrafast Wireless
I've never actually used a true LTE device, but I heard it's almost like WiFi which is great (Apple used the phrase, "&hellip;in some cases, better than WiFI."). When a carrier comes out with a family friendly pool plan, one connection, all devices for up to 4-5 people I doubt people in the know will keep their broadband connection.

## A6
To be expected, however the graphics seem to be similar quality to the Xbox 360. Can't wait to play some newer games and find out how responsive it is, how clear the game looks.

Overall, I think this is a great device, but I'll wait for NFC next year.
