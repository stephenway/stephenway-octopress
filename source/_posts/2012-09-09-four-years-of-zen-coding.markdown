Chris Coyier on Emmet for Sublime Text:
{% blockquote @chriscoyier https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/statuses/244904994216767491 %}
Zen Coding is being sunset and is now Emmet. For sublime: https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime &hellip; New features for CSS like w100p -> width: 100%;
{% endblockquote %}

Zen Coding was a huge leap forward for web designers when it was first released, among the many text editors it extended, it contributed to the rise of TextMate. I would be curious to see some numbers that show what text editor all the ex-TextMate users are using, I have a hunch the majority is Sublime Text.
