{% blockquote %}
Brits, take control of the web. Spiffing allows you to write your CSS and stylesheets in conformance to proper British English (also known as correct English) grammar and spelling regulations

A Brief Example
``` css
body {
    background-colour: grey !please;
    transparency: 0.5;
}
```
{% endblockquote %}

If I ever do a site for the UK I'm definitely using this.

Now all we need is a [Compass](http://www.compass-style.org) plugin that does this.
