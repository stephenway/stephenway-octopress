## Scorecard

{% img right /images/projects/scorecard/scorecard.png 350 scorecard.io %}

###### Responsive Design, HTML, SCSS, Javascript

Scorecard is a brand new website grader for insurance agents. This web
app allows agents to focus on search engine optimization, local search and more.

I worked with [Agency Revolution][agencyrevolution] to bring their design to
life by presenting a mockup that we refined through multiple iterations.
Through implementing this responsive design we improved the overall user
experience, typography through a vertical rhythm technique, and
application performance.

In the end this turned out to be a great way for
agents to improve their website.

## Compass-blueprint

{% img right /images/projects/compass-blueprint/compass-blueprint.png 350 compass-blueprint.org %}

###### Logo Design, Web Design, HTML, SCSS, Javascript

The official Blueprint.css extension for Compass has been the inspiration of
many developers in the past. Looking up mixins, variables and import paths is
easier than ever.

Chris Eppstein *(creator of Compass and Sass core team member)* asked me to take
all the Blueprint documentation and build a new site dedicated to Compass-blueprint.

## Mosaic Insurance Alliance

{% img right /images/projects/mosaic-insurance/mosaic-insurance.png 350 Mosaic Insurance Alliance %}

###### Web Design, HTML, SCSS, Javascript

Mosaic Insurance Alliance is a startup insurance agency in Washington
specializing in personal insurance lines. They wanted something fresh and
innovative for a new website. At the time of starting their design
I decided to utilize a new CSS framework called Susy that I had ported over to
our platform. One particularly successful element in this design was the
"catch-all" banner right above the footer prompting users to take action on
every page.

## StruCalc

###### Ecommerce, Web Design, HTML, SCSS, Javascript

StruCalc is the industry standard application for professionals in the
construction industry who need complex calculations and reports for structural
analysis. I worked with them on a new shopping cart and theme for it. The
minimal design lets shoppers focus on the products.

## Agency Revolution

{% img right /images/projects/agency-revolution/agency-revolution.png 350 Agency Revolution %}

###### Web Design, HTML, SCSS, Javascript

Agency Revolution is re-defining the way insurance agents and brokers attract
and convert new business through web redesigns, automated marketing and
training. This is the 3rd generation design, and it has been through a lot of
refinement and change to increase visitor interaction and sales.

## MobiQuote

{% img right /images/projects/warwick-resource/warwick-resource.png 350 Warwick Resource Group %}

###### Logo Design, Web Design, HTML, CSS, Javascript

This is a jQuery mobile site that optimizes the experience of Agency
Revolution's client sites. We took the average site's content and simplified it
down to the core needs of the visitor to optimize the time it takes mobile
users to get to what they want. Using the jQuery mobile framework I came up
with a flexible solution that allows it to be customized easily.

## Elaine Sanchez

###### Wordpress Theme Design, HTML, SCSS, Javascript

Elaine Sanchez is a renowned speaker on caregiver survivalism. I had the
pleasure of working with her on updating her Wordpress Theme for adding
features and performance/flexibility on different environments.

Additionally I worked with her on marketing collateral to help her spread word
of her new book "Letters to Madelyn".
